The Knora Base Ontology
***********************

Overview
========

The Knora base ontology is the main built-in Knora ontology. Each project that uses Knora must
describe its data model by creating ontologies that extend this ontology.

The Knora base ontology is identified by the IRI ``http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base``.
In the Knora documentation in general, it is identified by the prefix ``knora-base``, but for brevity,
in this document, we use ``kb`` or omit the prefix entirely.

.. _knora-data-model:

The Knora Data Model
====================

The Knora data model is based on the observation that, in the
humanities, a value or literal is often itself structured and can be
highly complex. Moreover, a value may have its own metadata, such as its
creation date, information about permissions, and so on.
Therefore, the Knora base ontology describes structured value types that
can store this type of metadata. In the diagram below, a book (``ex:book2``)
has a title (identified by the predicate ``ex:title``) and a publication
date (``ex:pubdate``), each of which has some metadata.

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
       book [label = "ex:book2", style = filled, fontcolor = white, color = navy, fillcolor = slateblue4]

       {
           node [style = filled, fontcolor = white, color = tomato3, fillcolor = tomato2]

           title [label = "kb:TextValue"]
           pubdate [label = "kb:DateValue"]
       }

       {
           node [shape = box, color = firebrick]

           titleStr [label = "‘King Lear’"]
           titleCreationDate [label = "2015-08-12 13:00"]

           startJDN [label = "2364669"]
           endJDN [label = "2364669"]
           pubdateCreationDate [label = "2015-08-12 13:03"]
       }

       edge [fontsize = 11, color = cyan4]

       book -> title [label = "ex:title"]
       book -> pubdate [label = "ex:pubdate"]

       title -> titleStr [label = "kb:valueHasString"]
       title -> titleCreationDate [label = "kb:valueCreationDate"]

       pubdate -> startJDN [label = "kb:valueHasStartJDN"]
       pubdate -> endJDN [label = "kb:valueHasEndJDN"]
       pubdate -> pubdateCreationDate [label = "kb:valueCreationDate"]
    }

Projects
--------

In Knora, each item of data belongs to some particular project. Each
project using Knora must define a ``kb:knoraProject``, which has these
properties (cardinalities are indicated in parentheses after each
property name):

``shortname`` (1)
    A short name that can be used to identify the project in
    configuration files and the like.

``basepath`` (1)
    The filesystem path of the directory where the project’s files are
    stored.

``foaf:name`` (0-1)
    The name of the project.

``description`` (0-1)
    A description of the project.

``belongsTo`` (0-1)
    The ``kb:Institution`` that the project belongs to.

Resources and values are associated with a project by means of the
``kb:attachedToProject`` property, as described in
:ref:`knora-data-model`. Users are associated with a project by means
of the ``kb:isInProject`` property, as described in :ref:`knora-base-users-and-groups`.

.. _knora-base-resources:

Resources
---------

All the content produced by a project (e.g. digitised primary source materials
or research data) must be stored in objects that belong to subclasses of
``kb:Resource``, so that the Knora API server can query and update that
content. Each project using the Knora base ontology must define its own OWL
classes, derived from ``kb:Resource``, to represent the types of data it deals
with. A subclass of ``kb:Resource`` may additionally be a subclass of any
other class, e.g. an industry-standard class such as ``foaf:Person``;
this can facilitate searches across projects.

Resources have properties that point to different parts of the content they
contain. For example, a resource representing a book could have a property
called ``hasAuthor``, pointing to the author of the book. There are two
possible kinds of content in a Knora resource: Knora values
(see :ref:`knora-base-values`) or links to other resources (see :ref:`knora-base-links`).
Properties that point to Knora values must be subproperties of
``kb:hasValue``, and properties that point to other resources must be
subproperties of ``kb:hasLinkTo``. Either of these two types of properties may
also be a subproperty of any other property, e.g. an industry-standard
property such as ``foaf:name``; this can facilitate searches across projects.
Each property definition must specify the types that its subjects and objects
must belong to (see :ref:`knora-base-property-restrictions` for details).

Each project-specific resource class definition must use OWL cardinality
restrictions to specify the properties that resources of that class can
have (see :ref:`knora-base-cardinalities` for details).

Resources are not versioned; only their values are versioned (see
:ref:`knora-base-values`).

Every resource is required to have an ``rdfs:label``. The object of this
property is an ``xsd:string``, rather than a Knora value; hence it is not
versioned. A user who has modify permission on a resource
(see :ref:`knora-base-authorization`) can change its label.

A resource can be marked as deleted; the Knora API server does this by adding
the predicate ``kb:isDeleted true`` to the resource. An optional
``kb:deleteComment`` may be added to explain why the resource has been marked
as deleted. Deleted resources are normally hidden. They cannot be undeleted,
because even though resources are not versioned, it is necessary to be able to
find out when a resource was deleted. If desired, a new resource can be
created by copying data from a deleted resource.


Properties of Resource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``creationDate`` (1)
    The time when the resource was created.

``attachedToUser`` (1)
    The user who owns the resource.

``attachedToProject`` (1)
    The project that the resource is part of.

``lastModificationDate`` (0-1)
    A timestamp indicating when the resource (or one of its values) was
    last modified.

``seqnum`` (0-1)
    The sequence number of the resource, if it is part of an ordered
    group of resources, such as the pages in a book.

``isDeleted`` (1)
    Indicates whether the resource has been deleted.

``deleteDate`` (0-1)
    If the resource has been deleted, indicates when it was deleted.

``deleteComment`` (0-1)
    If the resource has been deleted, indicates why it was deleted.

Resources can have properties that point to other resources; see
:ref:`knora-base-links`. A resource grants permissions to groups of users;
see :ref:`knora-base-authorization`.

.. _knora-base-representations:

Representations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is not practical to store all data in RDF. In particular, RDF is not
a good storage medium for binary data such as images. Therefore, Knora
stores such data outside the triplestore, in ordinary files. A resource
can have one or more files attached to it. For each file, there is a
``kb:FileValue`` in the triplestore containing metadata about the file
(see :ref:`knora-base-filevalue`). A resource that has file values
must belong to one of the subclasses of ``kb:Representation``. The base
class ``Representation``, which is not intended to be used directly, has
this property:

``hasFileValue`` (1-n)
    Points to one or more file values.

Its subclasses, which are intended to be used directly in data, include:

``StillImageRepresentation``
    A representation containing still image files.

``MovingImageRepresentation``
    A representation containing video files.

``AudioRepresentation``
    A representation containing audio files.

``DDDrepresentation``
    A representation containing 3D images.

``TextRepresentation``
    A representation containing formatted text files, such as XML files.

``DocumentRepresentation``
    A representation containing documents (such as PDF files) that are
    not text files.

There are two ways for a project to design classes for representations.
The simpler way is to create a resource class that represents a thing in
the world (such as ``ex:Painting``) and also belongs to a subclass of
``Representation``. This is adequate if the class can have only one type
of file attached to it. For example, if paintings are represented only
by still images, ``ex:Painting`` could be a subclass of
``StillImageRepresentation``. This is the only approach supported in
version 1 of the Knora API.

The more flexible approach, which is allowed by the Knora base ontology
and will be supported by version 2 of the Knora API, is for each
``ex:Painting`` to use the ``kb:hasRepresentation`` property to point to
other resources containing files that represent the painting. Each of
these other resources can extend a different subclass of
``Representation``. For example, a painting could have a
``StillImageRepresentation`` as well as a ``DDDrepresentation``.

Standard Resource Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In general, each project using Knora must define its own subclasses of
``kb:Resource``. However, the Knora base ontology provides some standard
subclasses of ``kb:Resource``, which are intended to be used by any
project:

``Region``
    Represents a region of a ``Representation`` (see :ref:`knora-base-representations`).

``Annotation``
    Represents an annotation of a resource. The ``hasComment`` property
    points to the text of the annotation, represented as a
    ``kb:TextValue``.

``LinkObj``
    Represents a link that connects two or more resources. A ``LinkObj``
    has a ``hasLinkTo`` property pointing to each resource that it
    connects, as well as a ``hasLinkToValue`` property pointing to a
    reification of each of these direct links (see :ref:`knora-base-links`).
    A ``LinkObj`` is more complex (and hence less convenient and
    readable) than a simple direct link, but it has the advantage that
    it can be annotated using an ``Annotation``. For improved
    readability, a project can make its own subclasses of ``LinkObj``
    with specific meanings.

.. _knora-base-values:

Values
------

The Knora base ontology defines a set of OWL classes that are derived
from ``kb:Value`` and represent different types of structured values
found in humanities data. This set of classes may not be extended by
project-specific ontologies.

A value is always part of one particular resource, which points to it
using some property derived from ``hasValue``. For example, a
project-specific ontology could specify a ``Book`` class with a property
``hasSummary`` (derived from ``hasValue``), and that property could have
a ``knora-base:objectClassConstraint`` of ``TextValue``. This would mean
that the summary of each book is represented as a ``TextValue``.

Knora values are versioned. Existing values are not modified. Instead, a
new version of an existing value is created. The new version is linked
to the old version via the ``previousValue`` property.

“Deleting” a value means marking it with ``kb:isDeleted``. An optional
``kb:deleteComment`` may be added to explain why the value has been
marked as deleted. Deleted values are normally hidden.

Most types of values are marked as deleted without creating a new
version of the value. However, link values must be treated as a special
case. Before a ``LinkValue`` can be marked as deleted, its reference
count must be decremented to 0. Therefore, a new version of the
``LinkValue`` is made, with a reference count of 0, and it is this new
version that is marked as deleted.

To simplify the enforcement of ontology constraints, and for consistency
with resource updates, no new versions of a deleted value can be made;
it is not possible to undelete. Instead, if desired, a new value can be
created by copying data from a deleted value.

Properties of Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``valueCreationDate`` (1)
    The date and time when the value was created.

``attachedToUser`` (1)
    The user who owns the value.

``attachedToProject`` (0-1)
    The project that the value is part of. If not specified, defaults to
    the project of the containing resource.

``valueHasString`` (1)
    A human-readable string representation of the value’s contents,
    which is available to Knora’s full-text search index.

``valueHasOrder`` (0-1)
    A resource may have several properties of the same type with
    different values (which will be of the same class), and it may be
    necessary to indicate an order in which these values occur. For
    example, a book may have several authors which should appear in a
    defined order. Hence, ``valueHasOrder``, when present, points to an
    integer literal indicating the order of a given value relative to
    the other values of the same property. These integers will not
    necessarily start at any particular number, and will not necessarily
    be consecutive.

``previousValue`` (0-1)
    The previous version of the value.

``isDeleted`` (1)
    Indicates whether the value has been deleted.

``deleteDate`` (0-1)
    If the value has been deleted, indicates when it was deleted.

``deleteComment`` (0-1)
    If the value has been deleted, indicates why it was deleted.

Each Knora value can grant permissions (see :ref:`knora-base-authorization`).

Subclasses of Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TextValue
~~~~~~~~~

Represents text, possibly including markup. The text is the object of
the ``valueHasString`` property. A line break is represented as a
Unicode line feed character (``U+000A``). The non-printing Unicode
character ``INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO (U+001E)`` can be used to separate
words that are separated only by standoff markup (see below), so they
are recognised as separate in a full-text search index.

Markup is stored using this property:

``valueHasStandoff`` (0-n)
    Points to a standoff markup tag. See :ref:`knora-base-standoff`.

``valueHasMapping`` (0-1)
    Points to the mapping used to create the standoff markup
    and to convert it back to the original XML. See :ref:`knora-base-mapping`.

.. _knora-base-date-value:

DateValue
~~~~~~~~~

Humanities data includes many different types of dates. In Knora, a date
has a specified calendar, and is always represented as a period with
start and end points (which may be equal), each of which has a precision
(``DAY``, ``MONTH``, or ``YEAR``). An optional ERA indicator term (``BCE``, ``CE``, or ``BC``, ``AD``) can be added to the date, when no era is provided the default era ``AD`` will be considered. Internally, the start and end points
are stored as two Julian Day Numbers. This calendar-independent
representation makes it possible to compare and search for dates
regardless of the calendar in which they were entered. Properties:

``valueHasCalendar`` (1)
    The name of the calendar in which the date should be displayed.
    Currently ``GREGORIAN`` and ``JULIAN`` are supported.

``valueHasStartJDN`` (1)
    The Julian Day Number of the start of the period (an
    ``xsd:integer``).

``valueHasStartPrecision`` (1)
    The precision of the start of the period.

``valueHasEndJDN`` (1)
    The Julian Day Number of the end of the period (an ``xsd:integer``).

``valueHasEndPrecision`` (1)
    The precision of the end of the period.

.. _knora-base-int-value:

IntValue
~~~~~~~~

Represents an integer. Property:

``valueHasInteger`` (1)
    An ``xsd:integer``.

.. _knora-base-color-value:

ColorValue
~~~~~~~~~~

``valueHasColor`` (1)
    A string representing a color. The string encodes a color as hexadecimal RGB values, e.g. "#FF0000".

.. _knora-base-decimal-value:

DecimalValue
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents an arbitrary-precision decimal number. Property:

``valueHasDecimal`` (1)
    An ``xsd:decimal``.

.. _knora-base-uri-value:

UriValue
~~~~~~~~

Represents a non-Knora URI. Property:

``valueHasUri`` (1)
    An ``xsd:anyURI``.

.. _knora-base-boolean-value:

BooleanValue
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a boolean value. Property:

``valueHasBoolean`` (1)
    An ``xsd:boolean``.

.. _knora-base-geom-value:

GeomValue
~~~~~~~~~

Represents a geometrical object as a JSON string, using normalized
coordinates. Property:

``valueHasGeometry`` (1)
    A JSON string.

.. _knora-base-geoname-value:

GeonameValue
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a geolocation, using the identifiers found at
GeoNames_. Property:

``valueHasGeonameCode`` (1)
    the identifier of a geographical feature from
    GeoNames_, represented as an ``xsd:string``.

.. _knora-base-interval-value:

IntervalValue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a time interval, with precise start and end times on a
timeline, e.g. relative to the beginning of an audio or video file.
Properties:

``valueHasIntervalStart`` (1)
    An ``xsd:decimal`` representing the start of the interval in
    seconds.

``valueHasIntervalEnd`` (1)
    An ``xsd:decimal`` representing the end of the interval in seconds.

.. _knora-base-list-value:

ListValue
~~~~~~~~~

Projects often need to define lists or hierarchies of categories that
can be assigned to many different resources. Then, for example, a user
interface can provide a drop-down menu to allow the user to assign a
category to a resource. The ``ListValue`` class provides a way to
represent these sorts of data structures. It can represent either a flat
list or a tree.

A ``ListValue`` has this property:

``valueHasListNode`` (1)
    Points to a ``ListNode``.

Each ``ListNode`` can have the following properties:

``isRootNode`` (0-1)
    Set to ``true`` if this is the root node.

``hasSubListNode`` (0-n)
    Points to the node’s child nodes, if any.

``hasRootNode`` (0-1)
    Points to the root node of the list (absent if ``isRootNode`` is ``true``).

``listNodePosition`` (0-1)
    An integer indicating the node’s position in the list of its
    siblings (absent if ``isRootNode`` is ``true``).

``listNodeName`` (0-1)
    The node’s human-readable name (absent if ``isRootNode`` is ``true``).

.. _knora-base-filevalue:

FileValue
~~~~~~~~~

Knora stores certain kinds of data outside the triplestore, in files
(see :ref:`knora-base-representations`). Each digital object that is
stored outside the triplestore has associated metadata, which is stored
in the triplestore in a ``kb:FileValue``. The base class ``FileValue``,
which is not intended to be used directly, has these properties:

``internalFilename`` (1)
    The name of the file as stored by the Knora API server.

``internalMimeType`` (1)
    The MIME type of the file as stored by the Knora API server.

``originalFilename`` (0-1)
    The original name of the file when it was uploaded to the Knora API
    server.

``originalMimeType`` (0-1)
    The original MIME type of the file when it was uploaded to the Knora
    API server.

``isPreview`` (0-1)
    A boolean indicating whether the file is a preview, i.e. a small
    image representing the contents of the file. A preview is always a
    ``StillImageFileValue``, regardless of the type of the enclosing
    ``Representation``.

The subclasses of ``FileValue``, which are intended to be used directly
in data, include:

``StillImageFileValue``
    Contains metadata about a still image file.

``MovingImageFileValue``
    Contains metadata about a video file.

``AudioFileValue``
    Contains metadata about an audio file.

``DDDFileValue``
    Contains metadata about a 3D image file.

``TextFileValue``
    Contains metadata about a text file.

``DocumentFileValue``
    Contains metadata about a document (such as PDF) that is not a text
    file.

Each of these classes contains properties that are specific to the type
of file it describes. For example, still image files have dimensions,
video files have frame rates, and so on.

The files in a given representation must be semantically equivalent,
meaning that coordinates that relate to one file must also be valid for
other files in the same representation. Coordinates in Knora are
expressed as fractions of the size of the object on some dimension; for
example, image coordinates are expressed as fractions of its width and
height, rather than in pixels. Therefore, the image files in a
``StillImageRepresentation`` must have the same aspect ratio, but they
need not have the same dimensions in pixels. Similarly, the audio and
video files in an ``AudioRepresentation`` or
``MovingImageRepresentation`` must have the same length in seconds, but
may have different bitrates.

``FileValue`` objects are versioned like other values, and the actual
files stored by Knora are also versioned. Version 1 of the Knora API
does not provide a way to retrieve a previous version of a file, but
this feature will be added in a subsequent version of the API.

.. _knora-base-linkvalue:

LinkValue
~~~~~~~~~

A ``LinkValue`` is an RDF “reification” containing metadata about a link
between two resources. It is therefore a subclass of ``rdf:Statement``
as well as of ``Value``. It has these properties:

``rdf:subject`` (1)
    The resource that is the source of the link.

``rdf:predicate`` (1)
    The link property.

``rdf:object`` (1)
    The resource that is the target of the link.

``valueHasRefCount`` (1)
    The reference count of the link. This is meaningful when the
    ``LinkValue`` describes resource references in Standoff text markup
    (see :ref:`knora-base-standoff-link`). Otherwise, the reference
    count will always be 1 (if the link exists) or 0 (if it has been
    deleted).

For details about how links are created in Knora, see :ref:`knora-base-links`.

ExternalResValue
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Represents a resource that is not stored in the RDF triplestore managed
by the Knora API server, but instead resides in an external repository
managed by some other software. The ``ExternalResValue`` contains the
information that the Knora API server needs in order to access the
resource, assuming that a suitable gateway plugin is installed.

``extResAccessInfo`` (1)
    The location of the repository containing the external resource
    (e.g. its URL).

``extResId`` (1)
    The repository-specific ID of the external resource.

``extResProvider`` (1)
    The name of the external provider of the resource.

.. _knora-base-links:

Links Between Resources
-----------------------

A link between two resources is expressed, first of all, as a triple, in
which the subject is the resource that is the source of the link, the
predicate is a “link property” (a subproperty of ``kb:hasLinkTo``), and
the object is the resource that is the target of the link.

It is also useful to store metadata about links. For example, Knora
needs to know who owns the link, who has permission to modify it, when
it was created, and so on. Such metadata cannot simply describe the link
property, because then it would refer to that property in general, not
to any particular instance in which that property is used to connect two
particular resources. To attach metadata to a specific link in RDF, it
is necessary to create an RDF “reification”. A reification makes
statements about a particular triple (subject, predicate, object), in
this case the triple that expresses the link between the resources.
Knora uses reifications of type ``kb:LinkValue`` (described in
:ref:`knora-base-linkvalue`) to store metadata about links.

For example, suppose a project describes paintings that belong to
collections. The project can define an ontology as follows (expressed
here in Turtle format, and simplified for the purposes of illustration):

::

    @prefix kb <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#> .
    @prefix : <http://www.knora.org/ontology/paintings#> .

    :Painting rdf:type owl:Class ;
        rdfs:subClassOf kb:Resource ,
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                owl:onProperty :hasArtist ;
                owl:cardinality 1 ] ,
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                  owl:onProperty :hasTitle ;
                  owl:cardinality 1 ] ;
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                  owl:onProperty :isInCollection ;
                  owl:minCardinality 1 ] ;
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                  owl:onProperty :isInCollectionValue ;
                  owl:minCardinality 1 ] .

    :Collection rdf:type owl:Class ;
        rdfs:subClassOf kb:Resource ,
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
                owl:onProperty :hasCollectionName ;
                owl:cardinality 1 ] .
                
    :hasArtist rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "Name of artist" ;
        kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ;
        kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue .
                
    :hasTitle rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "Title of painting"
        kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ;
        kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue .

    :hasCollectionName rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:label "Name of collection" ;
        kb:subjectClassConstraint :Collection ;
        kb:objectClassConstraint kb:TextValue .

To link the paintings to the collection, we must add a “link property”
to the ontology. In this case, the link property will point from a
painting to the collection it belongs to. Every link property must be a
subproperty of ``kb:hasLinkTo``.

::

    :isInCollection rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:hasLinkTo ;
        kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ;
        kb:objectClassConstraint :Collection .

We must then add a “link value property”, which will point from a
painting to a ``kb:LinkValue`` (described in
:ref:`knora-base-linkvalue`), which will contain metadata about the
link between the property and the collection. In particular, the link
value specifies the creator of the link, the date when it was created, and
the permissions that determine who can view or modify it. The name of
the link value property is constructed using a simple naming convention:
the word ``Value`` is appended to the name of the link property. In this
case, since our link property is called ``:isInCollection``, the
link value property must be called ``:isInCollectionValue``. Every link
value property must be a subproperty of ``kb:hasLinkToValue``.

::

    :isInCollectionValue rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        rdfs:subPropertyOf kb:hasLinkToValue ;
        kb:subjectClassConstraint :Painting ;
        kb:objectClassConstraint kb:LinkValue .

Given this ontology, we can create some RDF data describing a painting
and a collection:

::

We can then state that the painting is in the collection:

::

    data:dali_4587 paintings:isInCollection data:pompidou ;
        paintings:isinCollectionValue data:value_D .

    data:value_D rdf:type kb:LinkValue ;

        rdf:predicate paintings:isInCollection ;
        rdf:object data:pompidou ;
        kb:valueHasRefCount 1 .

This creates a link (``paintings:isInCollection``) between the painting and the
collection, along with a reification containing metadata about the link.
We can visualise the result as the following graph:

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
       {
           // Resources
           node [style = filled, fontcolor = white, color = navy, fillcolor = slateblue4]

           refCount [label = "1"]
           collectionNameStr [label = "‘Centre Pompidou’"]
       }

       edge [fontsize = 11, color = cyan4]

       work -> artistName [label = "hasArtist"]
       work -> collection [label = "isInCollection"]
       work -> linkValue [label = "isInCollectionValue"]

       collection -> collectionName [label = "hasCollectionName"]

       linkValue -> work [label = "subject"]
       linkValue -> isInCollection [label = "predicate"]
       linkValue -> collection [label = "object"]
    }

The Knora API server allows a user to see a link if
the requesting user has permission to see the source and target resources
as well as the ``kb:LinkValue``.

.. _knora-base-standoff:

Text with Standoff Markup
-------------------------

Knora is designed to be able to store text with markup, which can
indicate formatting and structure, as well as the complex observations
involved in transcribing handwritten manuscripts. One popular way of
representing text in the humanities is to encode it in XML
using the Text Encoding Initiative (`TEI`_) guidelines. [#]_ In Knora, a
TEI/XML document can be stored as a file with attached metadata, but
this is not recommended, because it does not allow Knora to perform
searches across multiple documents.

The recommended way to store text with markup in Knora is to use
Knora's built-in support for “standoff” markup, which is stored
separately from the text. This has some advantages over embedded markup
such as XML. [#]_ While XML requires markup to have a hierarchical
structure, and does not allow overlapping tags, standoff nodes do not
have these limitations. [Schmidt2016]_ A standoff tag can be attached to
any substring in the text by giving its start and end positions. [#]_
For example, suppose we have the following text:

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>This <i>sentence <strong>has overlapping</strong></i> <strong>visual</strong> attributes.</blockquote>

This would require just two standoff tags: ``(italic, start=5, end=29)``
and ``(bold, start=14, end=36)``.

Moreover, standoff makes it possible to mark up the same text in
different, possibly incompatible ways, allowing for different
interpretations without making redundant copies of the text. In the
Knora base ontology, any text value can have standoff tags.

By representing standoff as RDF triples, Knora makes markup searchable
across multiple text documents in a repository. For example, if a
repository contains documents in which references to persons are
indicated in standoff, it is straightforward to find all the documents
mentioning a particular person. Knora’s standoff support is intended to
make it possible to convert documents with embedded, hierarchical
markup, such as TEI/XML, into RDF standoff and back again, with no data
loss, thus bringing the benefits of RDF to existing TEI-encoded
documents.

In the Knora base ontology, a ``TextValue`` can have one or more
standoff tags. Each standoff tag indicates the start and end positions
of a substring in the text that has a particular attribute. The OWL
class ``kb:StandoffTag``, which is the base class of all standoff node
classes, has these properties:

``standoffTagHasStart`` (1)
    The index of the first character in the text that has the attribute.

``standoffTagHasEnd`` (1)
    The index of the last character in the text that has the attribute,
    plus 1.

``standoffTagHasUUID`` (1)
    A UUID identifying this instance and those corresponding to it
    in later versions of the ``TextValue`` it belongs to. The UUID is a means
    to maintain a reference to a particular range of a text also when new versions
    are made and standoff tag IRIs change.

``standoffTagHasOriginalXMLID`` (0-1)
    The original id of the XML element that the standoff tag represents, if any.

``standoffTagHasStartIndex`` (1)
    The start index of the standoff tag. Start indexes are numbered from 0 within the context of a
    particular text. When several standoff tags share the same start position,
    they can be nested correctly with this information when transforming them to XML.

``standoffTagHasEndIndex`` (1)
    The end index of the standoff tag. Start indexes are numbered from 0 within the context of a
    particular text. When several standoff tags share the same end position,
    they can be nested correctly with this information when transforming them to XML.

``standoffTagHasStartParent`` (0-1)
    Points to the parent standoff tag. This corresponds to the original nesting of tags in XML.
    If a standoff tag has no parent, it represents the XML root element.
    If the original XML element is a CLIX tag, it represents the start
    of a virtual (non syntactical) hierarchy.

``standoffTagHasEndParent`` (0-1)
    Points to the parent standoff tag if the original XML element is a CLIX tag and represents the end
    of a virtual (non syntactical) hierarchy.

The ``StandoffTag`` class is not used directly in RDF data; instead, its
subclasses are used. A few subclasses are currently provided in ``standoff-onto.ttl``, and more
will be added to support TEI semantics. Projects are able to define their own custom standoff tag
classes (direct subclasses of ``StandoffTag`` or one of the standoff data type classes or subclasses
of one of the standoff classes defined in ``standoff-onto.ttl``).

Subclasses of StandoffTag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Standoff Data Type Tags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Associates data in some Knora value type with a substring in a text. Standoff data type
tags are subclasses of ``ValueBase`` classes.

- ``StandoffLinkTag`` Indicates that a substring refers to another ``kb:Resource``.
    See :ref:`knora-base-standoff-link`.

- ``StandoffInternalReferenceTag`` Indicates that a substring refers to another standoff tag in the same text
    value. See :ref:`knora-base-standoff-internal-reference`.

- ``StandoffUriTag`` Indicates that a substring is associated with a
    URI, which is stored in the same form that is used for ``kb:UriValue``. See :ref:`knora-base-uri-value`.

- ``StandoffDateTag`` Indicates that a substring represents a
    date, which is stored in the same form that is used for ``kb:DateValue``. See :ref:`knora-base-date-value`.

- ``StandoffColorTag`` Indicates that a substring represents a color,
    which is stored in the same form that is used for ``kb:ColorValue``. See :ref:`knora-base-color-value`.

- ``StandoffIntegerTag`` Indicates that a substring represents an integer,
    which is stored in the same form that is used for ``kb:IntegerValue``. See :ref:`knora-base-int-value`.

- ``StandoffDecimalTag`` Indicates that a substring represents a number with fractions,
    which is stored in the same form that is used for ``kb:DecimalValue``. See :ref:`knora-base-decimal-value`.

- ``StandoffIntervalTag`` Indicates that a substring represents an interval,
    which is stored in the same form that is used for ``kb:IntervalValue``. See :ref:`knora-base-interval-value`.

- ``StandoffBooleanTag`` Indicates that a substring represents a Boolean,
    which is stored in the same form that is used for ``kb:BooleanValue``. See :ref:`knora-base-boolean-value`.

.. _knora-base-standoff-link:

StandoffLinkTag
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``StandoffLinkTag`` Indicates that a substring is associated with a
Knora resource. For example, if a repository contains resources
representing persons, a text could be marked up so that each time a
person’s name is mentioned, a ``StandoffLinkTag`` connects the name to
the Knora resource describing that person. Property:

``standoffTagHasLink`` (1)
    The IRI of the resource that is referred to.

One of the design goals of the Knora ontology is to make it easy and
efficient to find out which resources contain references to a given
resource. Direct links are easier and more efficient to query than
indirect links. Therefore, when a text value contains a resource
reference in its standoff nodes, the Knora API server automatically
creates a direct link between the containing resource and the target
resource, along with an RDF reification (a ``kb:LinkValue``) describing
the link, as discussed in :ref:`knora-base-links`. In this case, the link
property is always ``kb:hasStandoffLinkTo``, and the link value property
(which points to the ``LinkValue``) is always
``kb:hasStandoffLinkToValue``.

The Knora API server automatically updates direct links and reifications
for standoff resource references when text values are updated. To do
this, it keeps track of the number of text values in each resource that
contain at least one standoff reference to a given target resource. It
stores this number as the reference count of the ``LinkValue`` (see
:ref:`knora-base-linkvalue`) describing the direct link. Each time
this number changes, it makes a new version of the ``LinkValue``, with
an updated reference count. When the reference count reaches zero, it
removes the direct link and makes a new version of the ``LinkValue``,
marked with ``kb:isDeleted``.

For example, if ``data:R1`` is a resource with a text value in which the
resource ``data:R2`` is referenced, the repository could contain the
following triples:

::

    data:R1 ex:hasComment data:V1 .

    data:V1 rdf:type kb:TextValue ;
        kb:valueHasString "This link is internal." ;
        kb:valueHasStandoff data:SO1 .

    data:SO1 rdf:type kb:StandoffLinkTag ;
        kb:standoffTagHasStart: 5 ;
        kb:standoffTagHasEnd: 9 ;
        kb:standoffTagHasLink data:R2 .

    data:R1 kb:hasStandoffLinkTo data:R2 .
    data:R1 kb:hasStandoffLinkToValue data:LV1 . 

    data:LV1 rdf:type kb:LinkValue ;
        rdf:subject data:R1 ;
        rdf:predicate kb:hasStandoffLinkTo ;
        rdf:object data:R2 ;
        kb:valueHasRefCount 1 .

The result can be visualized like this:

.. graphviz::

   digraph {
       {
           // Resources
           node [style = filled, fontcolor = white, color = navy, fillcolor = slateblue4]

           r1 [label = "R1"]
           r2 [label = "R2"]
       }

       {
           // Values
           node [style = filled, fontcolor = white, color = tomato3, fillcolor = tomato2]

           v1 [label = "V1"]
           lv1 [label = "LV1"]
       }

       // Standoff tag
       so1 [label = "SO1", style = filled, fontcolor = white, color = darkgreen, fillcolor = forestgreen]

       {
           // Literals
           node [shape = box, color = firebrick]

           v1Str [label = "‘This link is internal.’"]
           tagStart [label = "5"]
           tagEnd [label = "9"]
           hasStandoffLinkTo [label = "hasStandoffLinkTo"]
           refCount [label = "1"]
       }

       edge [fontsize = 11, color = cyan4]

       r1 -> r2 [label = "hasStandoffLinkTo"]
       r1 -> v1 [label = "hasComment"]
       r1 -> lv1 [label = "hasStandoffLinkToValue"]

       v1 -> v1Str [label = "valueHasString"]
       v1 -> so1 [label = "valueHasStandoff"]

       so1 -> tagStart [label = "standoffTagHasStart"]
       so1 -> tagEnd [label = "standoffTagHasEnd"]
       so1 -> r2 [label = "standoffTagHasLink"]

       lv1 -> r1 [label = "subject"]
       lv1 -> hasStandoffLinkTo [label = "predicate"]
       lv1 -> r2 [label = "object"]
       lv1 -> refCount [label = "valueHasrefCount"]

       // Add an invisible edge to order tagStart and tagEnd from left to right.

       {
           rank = same
           tagStart -> tagEnd [style = invis]
           rankdir = LR
       }
    }

Link values created automatically for resource references in standoff
are visible to all users, and the creator of these link values
is always ``kb:SystemUser`` (see :ref:`knora-base-users-and-groups`).
The Knora API server allows a user to see a standoff link if the user
has permission to see the source and target resources.

.. _knora-base-standoff-internal-reference:

Internal Links in a TextValue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Internal links in a ``TextValue`` can be represented using the data type standoff class ``StandoffInternalReferenceTag`` or a subclass of it.
It has the following property:

``standoffTagHasInternalReference`` (1)
    Points to a ``StandoffTag`` that belongs to the same ``TextValue``.
    It has an ``objectClassConstraint`` of ``StandoffTag``.

For links to a ``kb:Resource``, see :ref:`knora-base-standoff-link`.

.. _knora-base-mapping:

Mapping to Create Standoff From XML
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A mapping allows for the conversion of an XML document to RDF-standoff
and back. A mapping defines one-to-one relations between XML elements (with or without a class) and attributes
and standoff classes and properties (see :ref:`XML-to-standoff-mapping`).

A mapping is represented by a ``kb:XMLToStandoffMapping`` which contains one or more ``kb:MappingElement``.
A ``kb:MappingElement`` maps an XML element (including attributes) to a standoff class and standoff properties.
It has the following properties:

``mappingHasXMLTagname`` (1)
    The name of the XML element that
    is mapped to a standoff class.

``mappingHasXMLNamespace`` (1)
    The XML namespace of the XML element that
    is mapped to a standoff class. If no namespace is given, ``noNamespace`` is used.

``mappingHasXMLClass`` (1)
    The name of the class of the XML element. If it has no class,
    ``noClass`` is used.

``mappingHasStandoffClass`` (1)
    The standoff class the XML element is mapped to.

``mappingHasXMLAttribute`` (0-n)
    Maps XML attributes to standoff properties using ``MappingXMLAttribute``. See below.

``mappingHasStandoffDataTypeClass`` (0-1)
    Indicates the standoff data type class
    of the standoff class the XML element is mapped to.

``mappingElementRequiresSeparator`` (1)
    Indicates if there should be an invisible word separator inserted
    after the XML element in the RDF-standoff representation. Once the markup is stripped, text segments that
    belonged to different elements may be concatenated.

A ``MappingXMLAttribute`` has the following properties:

``mappingHasXMLAttributename``
    The name of the XML attribute that is mapped to a standoff property.

``mappingHasXMLNamespace``
    The namespace of the XML attribute that is mapped to a standoff property.
    If no namespace is given, ``noNamespace`` is used.

``mappingHasStandoffProperty``
    The standoff property the XML attribute is mapped to.


Knora includes a standard mapping used by the SALSAH GUI. It has the IRI ``http://rdfh.ch/standoff/mappings/StandardMapping`` and defines
mappings for a few elements used to write texts with simple markup (see :ref:`XML-to-standoff-mapping`).

Standoff in Digital Editions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Knora’s standoff is designed to make it possible to convert XML
documents to standoff and back. One application for this feature is an
editing workflow in which an editor works in an XML editor, and the
resulting XML documents are converted to standoff and stored in Knora,
where they can be searched and annotated.

If an editor wants to correct text that has been imported from XML into
standoff, the text can be exported as XML, edited, and imported again.
To preserve annotations on standoff tags across edits, each tag can
automatically be given a UUID. In a future version of the Knora base
ontology, it will be possible to create annotations that point to UUIDs
rather than to IRIs. When a text is exported to XML, the UUIDs can be
included in the XML. When the edited XML is imported again, it can be
converted to new standoff tags with the same UUIDs. Annotations that
applied to standoff tags in the previous version of the text will
therefore also apply to equivalent tags in the new version.

When text is converted from XML into standoff, tags are also given
indexes, which are numbered from 0 within the context of a particular
text. This makes it possible to order tags that share the same position,
and to preserve the hierarchy of the original XML document. An ordinary,
hierarchical XML tag is converted to a standoff tag that has one index,
as well as the index of its parent tag, if any. The Knora base ontology
also supports non-hierarchical markup such as CLIX_, which
enables overlapping markup to be represented in XML. When
non-hierarchical markup is converted to standoff, both the start
position and the end position of the standoff tag have indexes and
parent indexes.

To support these features, a standoff tag can have these additional
properties:

``standoffTagHasStartIndex`` (0-1)
    The index of the start position.

``standoffTagHasEndIndex`` (0-1)
    The index of the end position, if this is a non-hierarchical tag.

``standoffTagHasStartParent`` (0-1)
    The IRI of the tag, if any, that contains the start position.

``standoffTagHasEndParent`` (0-1)
    The IRI of the tag, if any, that contains the end position, if
    this is a non-hierarchical tag.

``standoffTagHasUUID`` (0-1)
    A UUID that can be used to annotate a standoff tag that may be
    present in different versions of a text, or in different layers of a
    text (such as a diplomatic transcription and an edited critical
    text).

Querying Standoff in SPARQL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A future version of the Knora API server will provide an API for querying standoff markup.
In the meantime, it is possible to query it directly in SPARQL. For example, here is a
SPARQL query (using RDFS inference) that finds all the text values texts that have a standoff
date tag referring to Christmas Eve 2016, contained in a ``StandoffItalicTag``:

::

  PREFIX knora-base: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base#>
  PREFIX standoff: <http://www.knora.org/ontology/standoff#>

  select * where { 
      ?standoffTag a knora-base:StandoffDateTag  .
      
      ?standoffTag knora-base:valueHasStartJDN ?dateStart .
      ?standoffTag knora-base:valueHasEndJDN ?dateEnd .
      
      FILTER (2457747  <= ?dateEnd && 2457747  >= ?dateStart)
      
      ?standoffTag knora-base:standoffTagHasStartParent ?parent .
      ?parent a standoff:StandoffItalicTag .
      
      ?textValue knora-base:valueHasStandoff ?standoffTag .
      ?textValue knora-base:valueHasString ?string .
      
      ?standoffTag knora-base:standoffTagHasStart ?startPos .
      ?standoffTag knora-base:standoffTagHasEnd ?endPos .  
  }

.. _knora-base-authorization:

Authorization
=============

.. _knora-base-users-and-groups:

Users and Groups
----------------

Each Knora user is represented by an object belonging to the class
``kb:User``, which is a subclass of ``foaf:Person``, and has the
following properties:

``userid`` (1)
    A unique identifier that the user must provide when logging in.

``password`` (1)
    A cryptographic hash of the user’s password.

``email`` (0-n)
    Email addresses belonging to the user.

``isInProject`` (0-n)
    Projects that the user is a member of.

``isInGroup`` (0-n)
    Project-specific groups that the user is a member of.

``foaf:familyName`` (1)
    The user’s family name.

``foaf:givenName`` (1)
    The user’s given name.

Knora’s concept of access control is that an object (a resource or
value) can grant permissions to groups of users (but not to individual
users). There are four built-in groups:

``UnknownUser``
    Any user who has not logged into the Knora API server is
    automatically assigned to this group.

``KnownUser``
    Any user who has logged into the Knora API server is automatically
    assigned to this group.

``ProjectMember``
    When checking a user’s permissions on an object, the user is
    automatically assigned to this group if she is a member of the
    project that the object belongs to.

``Creator``
    When checking a user’s permissions on an object, the user is
    automatically assigned to this group if he is the creator of the
    object.

A project-specific ontology can define additional groups, which must
belong to the OWL class ``kb:UserGroup``.

There is one built-in ``SystemUser``, which is the creator of link values
created automatically for resource references in standoff markup (see
:ref:`knora-base-standoff-link`).

Permissions
-----------

An object can grant the following permissions, which are stored in a
compact format in a single string. This string is the object of the predicate
``kb:hasPermissions``, which is required on every ``kb:Resource`` and
``kb:Value``.

#. **Restricted view permission (RV)** Allows a restricted view of
   the object, e.g. a view of an image with a watermark.

#. **View permission (V)** Allows an unrestricted view of the
   object. Having view permission on a resource only affects the user’s
   ability to view information about the resource other than its values.
   To view a value, she must have view permission on the value itself.

#. **Modify permission (M)** For values, this permission allows a
   new version of a value to be created. For resources, this allows the
   user to create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an
   existing value), or to change information about the resource other
   than its values. When he wants to make a new version of a value, his
   permissions on the containing resource are not relevant. However,
   when he wants to change the target of a link, the old link must be
   deleted and a new one created, so he needs modify permission on the
   resource.

#. **Delete permission (D)** Allows the item to be marked as
   deleted.

#. **Change rights permission (CR)** Allows the permissions granted
   by the object to be changed.

Each permission in the above list implies all lower-numbered
permissions. A user’s permission level on a particular object is
calculated in the following way:

#. Make a list of the groups that the user belongs to, including
   ``Creator`` and/or ``ProjectMember`` if applicable.

#. Make a list of the permissions that she can obtain on the
   object, by iterating over the permissions that the object grants. For
   each permission, if she is in the specified group, add the specified
   permission to the list of permissions she can obtain.

#. From the resulting list, select the highest-level permission.

#. If the result is that she would have no permissions, give her
   whatever permission ``UnknownUser`` would have.

To view a link between resources, a user needs permission to view the
source and target resources. He also needs permission to view the
``LinkValue`` representing the link, unless the link property is
``hasStandoffLinkTo`` (see :ref:`knora-base-standoff-link`).

The format of the object of ``kb:hasPermissions`` is as follows:

-  Each permission is represented by the one-letter or two-letter
   abbreviation given above.

-  Each permission abbreviation is followed by a space, then a
   comma-separated list of groups that the permission is granted to.

-  The IRIs of built-in groups are shortened using the ``knora-base``
   prefix.

-  Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar (``|``).

For example, if an object grants view permission to unknown and known
users, and modify permission to project members, the resulting
permission literal would be:

::

    V knora-base:UnknownUser,knora-base:KnownUser|M knora-base:ProjectMember

Consistency Checking
====================

Knora tries to enforce repository consistency by checking constraints
that are specified in the Knora base ontology and in project-specific
ontologies. Three types of consistency rules are enforced:

-  Cardinalities in OWL class definitions must be satisfied.

-  Constraints on the types of the subjects and objects of OWL object
   properties must be satisfied.

-  A datatype property may not have an empty string as an object.

The implementation of consistency checking is partly
triplestore-dependent; Knora may be able to provide stricter checks with
some triplestores than with others.

.. _knora-base-cardinalities:

OWL Cardinalities
-----------------

As noted in :ref:`knora-base-resources`, each subclass of ``Resource``
must use OWL cardinality restrictions to specify the properties it can
have. More specifically, a resource is allowed to have a property that
is a subproperty of ``kb:hasValue`` or ``kb:hasLinkTo`` only if the
resource’s class has some cardinality for that property. Similarly, a
value is allowed to have a subproperty of ``kb:valueHas`` only if the
value’s class has some cardinality for that property.

Knora supports, and attempts to enforce, the following cardinality
constraints:

``owl:cardinality 1``
    A resource of this class must have exactly one instance of the
    specified property.

``owl:minCardinality 1``
    A resource of this class must have at least one instance of the
    specified property.

``owl:maxCardinality 1``
    A resource of this class may have zero or one instance of the
    specified property.

``owl:minCardinality 0``
    A resource of this class may have zero or more instances of the
    specified property.

Knora requires cardinalities to be defined using blank nodes, as in the
following example from ``knora-base``:

::

    :Representation rdf:type owl:Class ;
        rdfs:subClassOf :Resource ,
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
              owl:onProperty :hasFileValue ;
              owl:minCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] .
            
    :StillImageRepresentation rdf:type owl:Class ;
        rdfs:subClassOf :Representation ,
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
              owl:onProperty :hasStillImageFileValue ;
              owl:minCardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] .

Each ``owl:Restriction`` may have the predicate ``salsah-gui:guiOrder``
to indicate the order in which properties should be displayed in a GUI
(see :ref:`salsah-gui-properties`).

A resource class inherits cardinalities from its superclasses. This follows
from the rules of RDFS_ inference. Also, in Knora, cardinalities in the
subclass can override cardinalities that would otherwise be inherited from the
superclass. Specifically, if a superclass has a cardinality on a property P,
and a subclass has a cardinality on a subproperty of P, the subclass’s
cardinality overrides the superclass’s cardinality. In the example above,
``hasStillImageFileValue`` is a subproperty of ``hasFileValue``. Therefore,
the cardinality on ``hasStillImageFileValue`` overrides (i.e. replaces) the
one on ``hasFileValue``.

Note that, unlike cardinalities, predicates of properties are not inherited.
If ``:foo rdfs:subPropertyOf :bar``, this does not mean that ``:foo`` inherits
anything from ``:bar``. Any predicates of ``:foo`` that are also needed by
``:bar`` must be defined explicitly on ``:bar``. This design decision was made
because property predicate inheritance is not provided by RDFS inference,
and would make it more difficult to check the correctness of ontologies, while
providing little practical benefit.

Constraints on the Types of Property Subjects and Objects
---------------------------------------------------------

When a project-specific ontology defines a property, it must indicate
the types that are allowed as objects (and, if possible, as subjects) of the property. This
is done using the following Knora-specific properties:

``subjectClassConstraint``
    Specifies the class that subjects of the property must belong to.
    This constraint is recommended but not required. Knora will attempt
    to enforce this constraint.

``objectClassConstraint``
    If the property is an object property, specifies the class that
    objects of the property must belong to. Every subproperty of
    ``kb:hasValue`` or a ``kb:hasLinkTo`` (i.e. every property of a
    resource that points to a ``kb:Value`` or to another resource) is
    required to have this constraint, because the Knora API server relies
    on it to know what type of object to expect for the property. Knora
    will attempt to enforce this constraint.

``objectDatatypeConstraint``
    If the property is a datatype property, specifies the type of
    literals that can be objects of the property. Knora will not attempt
    to enforce this constraint, but it is useful for documentation
    purposes.

Consistency Constraint Example
------------------------------

A project-specific ontology could define consistency constraints as in
this simplified example:

::

    :book rdf:type owl:Class ;
        rdfs:subClassOf knora-base:Resource ,
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
              owl:onProperty :hasTitle ;
              owl:cardinality "1"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] ,
            [ rdf:type owl:Restriction ;
              owl:onProperty :hasAuthor ;
              owl:minCardinality "0"^^xsd:nonNegativeInteger ] .

    :hasTitle rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book ;
        knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue .

    :hasAuthor rdf:type owl:ObjectProperty ;
        knora-base:subjectClassConstraint :book ;
        knora-base:objectClassConstraint knora-base:TextValue .

Standardisation
===============

The DaSCH_ intends to coordinate the standardisation of generally useful
entities proposed in project-specific ontologies. We envisage a process in which
two or more projects would initiate the process by starting a public discussion
on proposed entities to be shared. Once a consensus was reached, the DaSCH_
would publish these entities in an ontology that could be used by multiple projects,
and would ensure that such ontologies are not subsequently modified in ways that break
compatibility with existing data. Functionality may be added to :ref:`knora-api-server`
to facilitate this process.

Notes
=====

.. [#]
   TEI refers both to an organization and an XML-based markup language
   (or more precisely: a set of grammar modules – XML schemas – that can
   be combined to define a markup language). For reasons of clarity, we
   use the term TEI/XML to refer to the markup language.

.. [#]
   It is also possible to encode standoff markup using XML. For example,
   the TEI guidelines discuss standoff markup. However, standoff markup
   is not widely applied in the TEI community. TEI's main focus is on
   encoding a hierarchy of elements.

.. [#]
   Unlike in corpus linguistics, we do not use any tokenization
   resulting in a form of predefined segmentation that would limit the
   user’s possibility to freely annotate any ranges in the text.
