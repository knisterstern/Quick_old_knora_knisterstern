Starting Fuseki 3
==================


Locally
-------

Inside the Knora API server git repository, there is a folder called
``triplestores/fuseki`` containing a script named ``fuseki-server``. All needed
configuration files are in place. To start Fuseki 3, just run this
script:

::

  $ ./fuseki-server

Inside Docker
--------------

We can use the ``dhlabbasel:fuseki`` docker image from docker hub:

::

  $ docker run --rm -it -p 3030:3030 dhlabbasel/fuseki
