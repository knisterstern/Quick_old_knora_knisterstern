v1.1.0 Release Notes
********************

See the `release`_ on Github.


Required changes to existing data:
----------------------------------


1. Project ontologies property changed:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``knora-base:projectOntologyGraph`` needs to be renamed to ``knora-base:projectOntology``. Also before it
was a ``xsd:string``, where now it needs to be an IRI. The graph where the ontology is stored will need to have
the same name.


2. Project data graph property removed:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The property ``knora-base:projectDataGraph`` needs to be removed.


2. Project shortcode property added:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``knora-base:projectShortcode`` property was added. When adding a project shortcode, we also need to update:

1. the IRI of the project to: ``http://rdfh.ch/projects/[shortcode]``
2. the IRIs all project ontologies to: ``http://www.knora.org/ontology/[shortcode]/[ontoname]``
3. the IRIs of lists to: ``http://rdfh.ch/lists/[shortcode]/[UUID]``
4. the IRIs of groups to: ``http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]``
