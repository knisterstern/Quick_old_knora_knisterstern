Setup Sipi for Knora
*********************


Setup and Execution
===================

In order to serve files to the client application like the Salsah GUI, Sipi must be set up and running.
Sipi can be downloaded from its own github-repository: https://github.com/dhlab-basel/Sipi.
Please follow the instructions given in the README to compile it on your system.

Once it is compiled, you can run Sipi with the following option: ``./local/bin/sipi --config=config/sipi.knora-config.lua``
(or ``./local/bin/sipi --config=sipi.knora-test-config.lua`` for using sipi for testing). Please see ``sipi.knora-config.lua``
for the settings like URL, port number etc.
These settings need to be set accordingly in Knora's ``application.conf``. If you use the default settings both in Sipi
and Knora, there is no need to change these settings.

Whenever a file is requested from Sipi (e.g. a browser trying to dereference an image link served by Knora), a preflight
function is called.
This function is defined in ``sipi.init-knora.lua`` present in the Sipi root directory. It takes three parameters:
``prefix``, ``identifier`` (the name of the requested file), and ``cookie``. File links created by Knora use the prefix
``knora``, e.g. ``http://localhost:1024/knora/incunabula_0000000002.jp2/full/2613,3505/0/default.jpg``.

Given these information, Sipi asks Knora about the current's users permissions on the given file.
The cookie contains the current user's Knora session id, so Knora can match Sipi's request with a given user profile and
determine the permissions this user has on the file.
If the Knora response grants sufficient permissions, the file is served in the requested quality. If the suer has preview
rights, Sipi serves a reduced quality or integrates a watermark.
If the user has no permissions, Sipi refuses to serve the file. However, all of this behaviour is defined in the preflight
function in Sipi and not controlled by Knora. Knora only provides the permission code.

See :ref:`sharing_sessionid_with_sipi` for more information about sharing the session id.


Using Sipi in Test Mode
=======================

If you just want to test Sipi with Knora without serving the actual files (e.g. when executing browser tests), you can
simply start Sipi like this: ``./local/bin/sipi --config=config/sipi.knora-test-config.lua``.
Then always the same test file will be served which is included in Sipi. In test mode, Sipi will not aks Knora about
the user's permission on the requested file.
